# Obstacle Avoidance Robot

## Overview
### *This project utilizes ROS2 Humble in conjunction with Gazebo and Rviz to create a robot equipped with a LIDAR sensor. The robot employs advanced concepts such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Navigation2 (Nav2) for effective mapping and obstacle avoidance.*

1- Launch the simulation environment.

2- Explore the 2D visualized map generated by the robot in Rviz.

3- Observe the robot's obstacle avoidance capabilities in the Gazebo simulation.

#### Concepts:

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
The project employs SLAM techniques to enable the robot to create a 2D visual map of its environment while simultaneously determining its own location within that space.

Nav2 (Navigation2)
Nav2 is utilized to enhance the robot's navigation capabilities, enabling it to efficiently plan and execute paths while avoiding obstacles in real-time.
